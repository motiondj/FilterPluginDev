## 🎯 Overview

The Advanced Filters Plugin provides professional-grade noise filtering for Unreal Engine projects. Perfect for smoothing noisy sensor data, stabilizing camera movement, improving VR/AR inputs, and creating more polished gameplay experiences.

### Key Features

- **Two Industry-Standard Filters**
  - **Kalman Filter**: Optimal state estimation with prediction
  - **One Euro Filter**: Low-latency adaptive filtering
  
- **User-Friendly Design**
  - 3-Node system for full control
  - One-click macros for instant filtering
  - Intuitive Low/Medium/High presets

- **Professional Features**
  - Float and Vector support
  - Custom presets
  - Filter chaining
  - Performance profiling
  - Auto-tuning

## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Pre-packaged Plugin
1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/AdvancedFilters/releases)
2. Extract to your project's `Plugins` folder
3. Restart Unreal Editor
4. Enable the plugin in Edit → Plugins → Advanced Filters

### Method 2: From Source
1. Clone this repository
2. Copy the `AdvancedFilters` folder to your project's `Plugins` directory
3. Right-click your `.uproject` file and select "Generate Visual Studio project files"
4. Compile your project

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Click Filtering (Easiest)

```blueprint
Event Tick
    ↓
[Get Sensor Value]
    ↓
[Kalman Filter Value]
- Preset: Medium
- Filter ID: "MySensor"
    ↓
[Set Filtered Value]
```

### 3-Node System (More Control)

```blueprint
Begin Play:
[Create Filter (Kalman)] → [Initialize (Medium)] → [Save as Variable]

Event Tick:
[Get Filter] → [Update Estimate (Sensor Value)] → [Use Result]
```

## 📊 Filter Comparison

| Feature | Kalman Filter | One Euro Filter |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Best For** | Predictable motion, sensors | User input, VR/AR |
| **Latency** | 5-10 frames | 0-3 frames |
| **Smoothness** | Very smooth | Adaptive |
| **Noise Reduction** | 95%+ | 85%+ |

## 🎮 Common Use Cases

### Camera Stabilization (Kalman)
```blueprint
[Get Camera Shake] → [Kalman Filter Vector] → [Set Camera Location]
```

### VR Controller (One Euro)
```blueprint
[Get Controller Position] → [One Euro Filter Vector] → [Update Hand Mesh]
```

### Mouse Smoothing (One Euro)
```blueprint
[Get Mouse Delta] → [One Euro Filter Value] → [Apply Turn Input]
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Custom Presets
Create your own filter configurations:
```blueprint
[Create Custom Preset]
- Name: "MyVRConfig"
- Process Noise: 0.05
- Beta: 0.0001
```

### Filter Chaining
Combine multiple filters:
```blueprint
[Create Filter Chain] → [Kalman + OneEuro] → [Process Through Chain]
```

### Performance Profiling
Measure filter performance:
```blueprint
[Start Profiling] → [Filter Operations] → [Stop Profiling]
```

## 📊 Performance

- **CPU Usage**: < 0.1% per filter instance
- **Memory**: ~100-150 bytes per filter
- **Latency**: 0-10 frames depending on filter and preset
